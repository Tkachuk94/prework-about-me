  <!--Introduction-->
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Trent Tkachuk, I am currently 27 years old and currently work
          for the City of San Diego as a Water Utility Worker. But, have a passion 
          for technology and want to pursue something more along with my passion.
          This is what has led me into joining a Coding Bootcamp which I am 
          extremely excited for and cannot wait to develop my abilities and pursue 
          the next step in my life.
        </p>
 
<!--From-->     
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p>
            I was born in El Cajon, CA in 1994 and moved from there in 2004 to Temecula, CA. 
            This is where I first became enamored with technology, and had taken many PC related elective classes
            that my high school had offered including: PC repair, 3D animation, photoshop and Web Design.
          </p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Building Computers</li>

          <li>Tearing apart electronics to better understand how they work</li>
          <li>Simply trying something new</li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>
            I have been custom building computers since I was 11 years 
            old and was highly into gaming. Technology has always been a massive
            passion of mine and im extremely excited to finally diving fully into 
            a far more technical related job field.
          </p>
<!--Dream-->     
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>
          My dream job would definitely be a full stack developer that has the ability to on the average
          day to day work cycle work remotely as I am highly Self-motivated, Enjoy zoning out my surrondings 
          and just focusing on difficult tasks until completion and being able to finally see the completion 
          of large projects.
        </p>
<!--Current live-->      
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>
          Currently, I live in Scripps Ranch within San Diego, CA but as I know a majority of companies that will be hiring
          low experienced developers would perfer them to work in an office setting atleast for a majority
          of their week, I would be happy to relocate anywhere.
      </p>
<!--Why?-->     
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>
            The main reason that I want to be a Web Developer is due to seeing that it will be a long term career oppertunity.
            Giving me the option to jump full into a far more technical related position than I currently work and as it is something
            that I actually can see myself doing my entire life.
